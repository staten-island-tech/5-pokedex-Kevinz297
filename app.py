# Add a language choice feature and print the pokemons name based on the user input

# Develop a function that creates a new list of pokemon based on the type the user searched for. If no pokemon was found of that type inform the user

#Develop a function to find all pokemon matching the name the user searched for. Ex. if "Char" return Charmander, Charmeleon and Charizard. Make the user aware if no pokemon was found.
